    "There is a crucial scientific information about shark attacks on surfers: when surfers are laying down on top of their surfboards, they look much alike sea lions and turtles - which are shark's pray This is called the 'Mistaken Identity Theory' (https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2021.0533).\n",
    "So there is a belief that sharks mistaken surfers with their natural prays.\n",
    "Another relevant information is about the size of the surfboards. Longboards for instance are huge surfboards (9ft+). So just like in the animal kingdom, predators are more likely to attack a pray that is, in most cases, smaller than them. The data base does not have information about the victims hight or weight, neither the size of the surfboards that they were riding at the time of the incident. However, the data base provides demographic information such as age.\n",
    "Younger surfers are smaller than adults and they ride smaller surfboards making them a easier pray for sharks. Although the number of adult surfers are larger than the number of youth surfers, the logic would put a smaller being as the primary target for sharks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "First Hypothesis: SURFERS UP TO 19 YEARS OLD HAVE MORE CHANCES TO BE ATTACKED BY SHARKS.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you paddle out in famous places such as Hawaii and Australia, you will notice that older man and woman of all ages usually rides Longboards. Although the number of woman riding short boards have been growing exponentially in the last decade, there is still a discrepancy out there.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Second Hypothesis: EVEN IF WE ADD THE NUMBER OF OLDER MEN SURFERS VICTIMS (62+ YEARS) AND THE NUMBER OF WOMAN SURFERS VICTIMS OF ALL AGES, THE RESULT STILL GOING TO BE SMALLER THAN THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS UP TO 19 YEARS OLD."
