# Project Shark Attack
Status (completed)

# Project Objective
Clean, organize, analyse and visualize the dataset to test the following hypothesis:  

1. Hypothesis:  
**SURFERS UP TO 19 YEARS OLD HAVE MORE CHANCES TO BE ATTACKED BY SHARKS.**  

1.1. There is a crucial scientific information about shark attacks on surfers: when surfers are laying down on top of their surfboards, they look much alike sea lions and turtles - which are shark's prays.
This is called the 'Mistaken Identity Theory' (https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2021.0533).
So there is a belief that sharks mistaken surfers with their natural prays.
Another relevant information is about the size of the surfboards. Longboards for instance are huge surfboards (9ft+). So just like in the animal kingdom, predators are more likely to attack a pray that is, in most cases, smaller than them. The dataset does not have information about the victims hight or weight, neither the size of the surfboards that they were riding at the time of the incident. However, the dataset provides demographic information such as age.
Younger surfers are smaller than adults and they ride smaller surfboards making them a easier pray for sharks. Although the number of adult surfers are larger than the number of youth surfers, the logic would put a smaller being as the primary target for sharks.  

2. Hypothesis:   
**EVEN IF WE ADD THE NUMBER OF ELDERLY MAN SURFERS VICTIMS (62+ YEARS) AND THE NUMBER OF WOMAN SURFERS VICTIMS OF ALL AGES, THE RESULT STILL GOING TO BE SMALLER THAN THE NUMBER OF VICTIMS UP TO 19 YEARS OLD.**  
2.1. When surfers paddle out in famous places such as Hawaii and Australia, one would notice that elderly man and woman of all ages usually ride Funboards and Longboards (7 - 9ft+).  
Considering the scientific theory mentioned on the first hypothesis, one could assume that sharks would prefer to attack surfers whose are riding shorter boards rather than bigger and longer surfboards. Smaller prey = easier prey. 
Therefore surfers riding longer boards are less likely to be attacked by sharks.
